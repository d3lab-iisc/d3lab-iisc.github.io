abstract: Soda-lime glass (SLG) and other silica glasses exhibit the failure wave
  phenomenon under shock compression. The mechanism responsible for this peculiar
  behavior of glasses is still unresolved. In this study, a series of plate impact
  experiments was performed at three different impact stresses of 6.4, 8.3, and 10.8 GPa
  to better understand the mechanisms underlying the failure wave phenomenon. Specifically,
  spall experiments were conducted to probe the speed and existence of failure waves
  at different stresses in SLG. A layered glass target was used to probe the possibility
  of a “renucleation” of the wave at the SLG–SLG interface. When it existed, the failure
  wave was inferred to propagate at a speed of 1.3 km/s. However, it was observed
  that the failure wave phenomenon ceases to exist for impact stresses higher than
  10 GPa. In experiments with a 6.4 GPa impact stress, the peak free surface velocity
  was significantly less than what is predicted by stress-Hugoniot calculations. This
  velocity deficit and other important features of the measured free surface velocity
  profiles were simulated using finite element analysis by incorporating an abrupt
  densification of SLG at a critical stress in the equation of state. This densification
  feature is similar to what would be expected of a phase transition. Although unable
  to unambiguously reveal the mechanism causing the failure wave phenomenon, the results
  of the present work clearly indicate that the failure wave causes a secondary compression
  and densification in SLG.
