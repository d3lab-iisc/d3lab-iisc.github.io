abstract: We propose a computational framework, Hetero-EUCLID, for segmentation and
  parameter identification to characterize the full hyperelastic behavior of all constituents
  of a heterogeneous material. In this work, we leverage the Bayesian-EUCLID (Efficient
  Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery) framework to efficiently
  solve the heterogenized formulation through parsimonious model selection using sparsity-promoting
  priors and Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling. We utilize experimentally observable
  3D surface displacement and boundary-averaged force data generated from Finite Element
  simulations of non-equi-biaxial tension tests on heterogeneous specimens. The framework
  broadly consists of two steps -- residual force-based segmentation, and constitutive
  parameter identification. We validate and demonstrate the ability of the proposed
  framework to segment the domain, and characterize the constituent materials on various
  types of thin square heterogeneous domains. We validate of the framework's ability
  to segment and characterize materials with various levels of displacement noises
  and non-native mesh discretizations, i.e, using different meshes for the forward
  FE simulations and the inverse EUCLID problem. This demonstrates Hetero-EUCLID framework's
  applicability in Digital Image/Volume Correlation-based experimental scenarios.
  Furthermore, the proposed framework performs successful segmentation and material
  characterizations based on data from a single experiment, thereby making it viable
  for rapid, interpretable model discovery in domains such as aerospace and defense
  composites and for characterization of selective tissue stiffening in medical conditions
  such as fibroatheroma, atherosclerosis, or cancer.
