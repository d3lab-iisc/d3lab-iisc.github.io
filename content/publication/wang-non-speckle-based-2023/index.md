abstract: X-ray computed tomography (XCT) has become a reliable metrology tool for
  measuring internal flaws and other microstructural features in engineering materials.
  However, tracking of material points to measure three-dimensional (3D) deformations
  has hitherto relied on either artificially adding tracer particles (speckles) or
  exploiting inherent microstructural features such as inclusions. This has greatly
  limited the spatial resolution and magnitude of the deformation measurements. Here
  we report a novel Flux Enhanced Tomography for Correlation (FETC) technique that
  leverages the inherent inhomogeneities within nominally homogeneous engineering
  polymers to track 3D material point displacements without recourse to artificial
  speckles or microstructural features such as inclusions. The FETC is then combined
  with a Eulerian/Lagrangian transformation in a multi-step Digital Volume Correlation
  (DVC) methodology to measure all nine components of the deformation gradient within
  the volume of complex specimens undergoing extreme deformations. FETC is a powerful
  technique that greatly expands the capabilities of laboratory-based XCT to provide
  amongst other things the inputs required for data-driven constitutive modelling
  approaches.
