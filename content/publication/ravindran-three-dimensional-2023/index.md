abstract: Shock compression plate impact experiments conventionally rely on point-wise
  velocimetry measurements based on laser-based interferometric techniques. This study
  presents an experimental methodology to measure the free surface full-field particle
  velocity in shock compression experiments using high-speed imaging and three-dimensional
  (3D) digital image correlation (DIC). The experimental setup has a temporal resolution
  of 100 ns with a spatial resolution varying from 90 to 200 μm/pixel. Experiments
  were conducted under three different plate impact configurations to measure spatially
  resolved free surface velocity and validate the experimental technique. First, a
  normal impact experiment was conducted on polycarbonate to measure the macroscopic
  full-field normal free surface velocity. Second, an isentropic compression experiment
  on Y-cut quartz–tungsten carbide assembly is performed to measure the particle velocity
  for experiments involving ramp compression waves. To explore the capability of the
  technique in multiaxial loading conditions, a pressure shear plate impact experiment
  was conducted to measure both the normal and transverse free surface velocities
  under combined normal and shear loading. The velocities measured in the experiments
  using digital image correlation are validated against previous data obtained from
  laser interferometry. Numerical simulations were also performed using established
  material models to compare and validate the experimental velocity profiles for these
  different impact configurations. The novel ability of the employed experimental
  setup to measure full-field free surface velocities with high spatial resolutions
  in shock compression experiments is demonstrated for the first time in this work.
