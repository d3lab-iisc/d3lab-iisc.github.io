abstract: The mechanical response of rubbers has been ubiquitously assumed to be only
  a function of the imposed strain. Using innovative X-ray measurements capturing
  the three-dimensional spatial volumetric strain fields, we demonstrate that rubbers
  and indeed many common engineering polymers undergo significant local volume changes.
  But remarkably, the overall specimen volume remains constant regardless of the imposed
  loading. This strange behavior which also leads to apparent negative local bulk
  moduli is due to the presence of a mobile phase within these materials. Combining
  X-ray tomographic observations with high-speed radiography to track the motion of
  the mobile phase, we have revised classical thermodynamic frameworks of rubber elasticity.
  The work opens broad avenues to understand not only the mechanical behavior of rubbers
  but a large class of widely used engineering polymers.
