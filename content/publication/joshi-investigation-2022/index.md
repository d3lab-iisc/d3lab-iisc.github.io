abstract: There exists a large body of evidence from experiments and molecular dynamics
  simulations to suggest the occurrence of phase transitions in soda-lime glass (SLG)
  and other silica glasses subject to shock compression to pressures above 3 GPa.
  In light of these findings, the current work investigated the existence of phase
  transition in SLG using shock and release experiments. The experiments employed
  symmetric SLG–SLG impact to achieve complete unloading to zero stress after shock
  compression to stresses in the range of 3–7 GPa. The stress–strain response and
  the Lagrangian release wave speed behavior of SLG obtained from these experiments
  are seen to reveal a mismatch between the loading and unloading paths of the pressure–strain
  curve for the material, which serves as compelling evidence for the occurrence of
  a shock-induced phase transition in the material at relatively low pressures. Furthermore,
  the release wave speed vs strain data obtained from experiments were used to construct
  a methodology for modeling the shock and release behavior of SLG. This scheme implemented
  in numerical simulations was able to capture the release behavior of shock compressed
  SLG, for which a robust and satisfactory model was previously unavailable.
