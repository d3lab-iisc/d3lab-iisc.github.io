I am a second-year Mechanical Engineering student with a deep interest in emerging technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms, Web Development, and Robotics. I enjoy integrating engineering principles with computational tools to solve real-world problems. My current projects involve both theoretical and applied aspects of engineering and computer science, and I am actively exploring intersections between fluid mechanics, intelligent systems, and simulation-driven design.
