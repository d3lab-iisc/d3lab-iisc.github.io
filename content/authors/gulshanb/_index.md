I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering from [CSVTU](https://csvtu.ac.in/), Bhilai, with a strong foundation in Mechanical Engineering. After completing my degree, I worked at [Blue Chip](https://www.bluechipindia.co.in/), a Raipur-based consultancy firm, for 1.5 years. This experience provided me with invaluable exposure to industrial practices, allowing me to enhance my technical expertise and professional acumen.

Currently, I am pursuing research at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), where I am part of the Dynamic Data Design (DDD) Lab. My work focuses on mechanical mechanisms and their integration with machine learning. This unique combination of fields has enabled me to explore innovative solutions and contribute to advancements at the intersection of engineering and machine learning.
