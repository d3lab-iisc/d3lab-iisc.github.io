I am a researcher passionate about exploring the fascinating world of advanced materials. My work is focused on metamaterials, wave physics, and architected materialsâ€”fields that hold immense potential to revolutionize the way we understand and design materials.

Bridging theoretical insights with experimental precision, I specialize in finite element analysis and data-driven approaches to uncover the intricate dynamics of heterogeneous materials and architected materials. Through my research, I aim to bring clarity to complex physical phenomena and contribute to innovations that redefine advanced material.
