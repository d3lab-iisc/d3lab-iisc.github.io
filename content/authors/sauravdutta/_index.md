I completed by Bachelorâ€™s degree from National Institute of Technology Silchar, after which I worked in metamaterials and wave physics in Aerospace Engineering dept at IISc. Currently, I am working as a Research Associate in the Dept of Mechanical Engineering at IISc on Hetero-EUCLID. In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy reading books, playing chess, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

> **Project:** Inverse Design of Heterogenous Material
