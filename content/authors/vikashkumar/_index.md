Vikash Kumar is a researcher in computational solid mechanics and materials modeling. He is currently a Project Associate I at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, where he works on physics-informed machine learning and deep learning frameworks for advanced materials modeling. He earned his M.Tech. in Solid Mechanics and Design from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where his master’s thesis focused on molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen embrittlement in nickel. His research interests span material failure mechanics, multiscale simulations, nonlinear FEM, and data-driven modeling of complex materials, with a broader goal of integrating physics-based principles with AI to enable predictive materials design and reliability assessment.
