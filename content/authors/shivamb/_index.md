My journey began with five years of schooling at Shree Swaminarayan Gurukul, Surat. I pursued my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Nirma University, where I developed a strong passion for research under the guidance of Prof. Absar Lakdawala in the CFD Lab. This interest deepened during my time working with Prof. Atul Sharma in the CFD Lab at IIT Bombay.

After successfully clearing the GATE exam, I joined the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore for a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. At IISc, my focus expanded to exploring physical systems that can train neural networks, paving the way for efficient and innovative AI systems.
