| ME262 (3:0)     | Wave Propagation in Solids                    |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Instructors** | Debashish Das, Akshay Joshi                   |
| **Venue**       | MMCR, Mechanical Engineering Department, IISc |
| **Time**        | Tuesday and Thursday, 11:30 AM- 1:00 PM       |

### Syllabus:
Uniaxial stress waves (equation of motion, x-t diagrams, reflection at boundaries, impedance mismatch); Uniaxial strain waves (method of characteristics); Bulk waves in 2D and 3D media (longitudinal & shear waves, Rayleigh and Stoneley waves, plane waves in 2D, reflection and refraction); Wave guides (dispersion, phase & group velocities, vibrating beams, Love waves, plate problems, 3D bar problems); Spherical waves (Impact of half spaces, Boussinesq & Lamb problems, unloading waves); Shock waves (1D shock waves, Rankine-Hugoniot relations, equation of state); Dynamic testing techniques (Split Hopkinson bars, plate impact, Taylor test, expanding ring).

### Prerequisites:
Basic knowledge of solid mechanics.

### Resources:
- M. A. Meyers, “Dynamic behavior of Materials”, Wiley, New York, NY, 1994.
- J. D. Achenbach, “Wave propagation in elastic solids”, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1990.
- H. Kolsky, “Stress waves in solids”, Dover, New York, 1963.
- Zukas et al., “Impact dynamics”, Krieger, Malabar, FL, 1992.
- L. M. Brekhovskikh & V. Goncharov, “Elastic Waves in Solids”, Springer, Berlin, 1994.

### Outcomes:
The course will help students gain a deep understanding of wave propagation phenomena in solids, develop problem-solving skills, and prepare for careers in fields such as engineering, physics, and acoustics.
 
### Additional information:
Target Audience (Interested students/researchers in the field of): 
Dynamic testing of materials (such as using Split-Hopkinson bars).
Physics, engineering, geology, or acoustics who are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of wave phenomena and their applications in their respective fields.
