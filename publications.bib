	abstract = {Soda-lime glass (SLG) and other silica glasses exhibit the failure wave phenomenon under shock compression. The mechanism responsible for this peculiar behavior of glasses is still unresolved. In this study, a series of plate impact experiments was performed at three different impact stresses of 6.4, 8.3, and 10.8 GPa to better understand the mechanisms underlying the failure wave phenomenon. Specifically, spall experiments were conducted to probe the speed and existence of failure waves at different stresses in SLG. A layered glass target was used to probe the possibility of a “renucleation” of the wave at the SLG–SLG interface. When it existed, the failure wave was inferred to propagate at a speed of 1.3 km/s. However, it was observed that the failure wave phenomenon ceases to exist for impact stresses higher than 10 GPa. In experiments with a 6.4 GPa impact stress, the peak free surface velocity was significantly less than what is predicted by stress-Hugoniot calculations. This velocity deficit and other important features of the measured free surface velocity profiles were simulated using finite element analysis by incorporating an abrupt densification of SLG at a critical stress in the equation of state. This densification feature is similar to what would be expected of a phase transition. Although unable to unambiguously reveal the mechanism causing the failure wave phenomenon, the results of the present work clearly indicate that the failure wave causes a secondary compression and densification in SLG.},

	abstract = {There exists a large body of evidence from experiments and molecular dynamics simulations to suggest the occurrence of phase transitions in soda-lime glass (SLG) and other silica glasses subject to shock compression to pressures above 3 GPa. In light of these findings, the current work investigated the existence of phase transition in SLG using shock and release experiments. The experiments employed symmetric SLG–SLG impact to achieve complete unloading to zero stress after shock compression to stresses in the range of 3–7 GPa. The stress–strain response and the Lagrangian release wave speed behavior of SLG obtained from these experiments are seen to reveal a mismatch between the loading and unloading paths of the pressure–strain curve for the material, which serves as compelling evidence for the occurrence of a shock-induced phase transition in the material at relatively low pressures. Furthermore, the release wave speed vs strain data obtained from experiments were used to construct a methodology for modeling the shock and release behavior of SLG. This scheme implemented in numerical simulations was able to capture the release behavior of shock compressed SLG, for which a robust and satisfactory model was previously unavailable.},

	abstract = {Shock compression plate impact experiments conventionally rely on point-wise velocimetry measurements based on laser-based interferometric techniques. This study presents an experimental methodology to measure the free surface full-field particle velocity in shock compression experiments using high-speed imaging and three-dimensional (3D) digital image correlation (DIC). The experimental setup has a temporal resolution of 100 ns with a spatial resolution varying from 90 to 200 μm/pixel. Experiments were conducted under three different plate impact configurations to measure spatially resolved free surface velocity and validate the experimental technique. First, a normal impact experiment was conducted on polycarbonate to measure the macroscopic full-field normal free surface velocity. Second, an isentropic compression experiment on Y-cut quartz–tungsten carbide assembly is performed to measure the particle velocity for experiments involving ramp compression waves. To explore the capability of the technique in multiaxial loading conditions, a pressure shear plate impact experiment was conducted to measure both the normal and transverse free surface velocities under combined normal and shear loading. The velocities measured in the experiments using digital image correlation are validated against previous data obtained from laser interferometry. Numerical simulations were also performed using established material models to compare and validate the experimental velocity profiles for these different impact configurations. The novel ability of the employed experimental setup to measure full-field free surface velocities with high spatial resolutions in shock compression experiments is demonstrated for the first time in this work.},

	abstract = {X-ray computed tomography (XCT) has become a reliable metrology tool for measuring internal flaws and other microstructural features in engineering materials. However, tracking of material points to measure three-dimensional (3D) deformations has hitherto relied on either artificially adding tracer particles (speckles) or exploiting inherent microstructural features such as inclusions. This has greatly limited the spatial resolution and magnitude of the deformation measurements. Here we report a novel Flux Enhanced Tomography for Correlation (FETC) technique that leverages the inherent inhomogeneities within nominally homogeneous engineering polymers to track 3D material point displacements without recourse to artificial speckles or microstructural features such as inclusions. The FETC is then combined with a Eulerian/Lagrangian transformation in a multi-step Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) methodology to measure all nine components of the deformation gradient within the volume of complex specimens undergoing extreme deformations. FETC is a powerful technique that greatly expands the capabilities of laboratory-based XCT to provide amongst other things the inputs required for data-driven constitutive modelling approaches.},

	abstract = {Soda-lime glass (SLG) and other silica glasses find use in many technological applications involving high pressures and strain rates, such as systems with laser-matter interactions, transparent armor, etc. An experimentally validated constitutive model for these glasses is required for modeling their mechanical behavior at high pressures and strain rates. Also, due to the abundance of silica in the earth's crust, understanding the behavior of these glasses at high pressures can provide significant insights into many geophysical processes. To this end, shock compression experiments are carried out on SLG to study the material's behavior under impact stresses of 5-10 GPa. These experiments are accompanied by numerical simulations and constitutive modeling of SLG to gain further insights into the reported failure-wave phenomenon and phase transitions associated with the material.

The significant findings of this study in relation to the failure-wave phenomenon were the sudden densification/compaction of SLG associated with the failure-wave and the disappearance of the failure-wave phenomenon for impact stresses above 10 GPa. When viewed in the context of the findings from past experiments, these results seem to suggest that localized densification/compaction of SLG causes nucleation of cracks and subsequent comminution in the material under shock compression. These results and observations offer a potential explanation of the mechanism underlying the failure-wave phenomenon.

Further, the shock compression and release experiments performed in this work provided significant insights into the onset of possible phase-transition in SLG under shock compression. A loading-unloading hysteresis is observed in the material’s stress-strain curve for impact stresses higher than 5.8 GPa, with the permanent/residual strain increasing with impact stress. Further analysis of these results strongly indicates that the hysteresis is more likely due to a gradual, irreversible phase transition of SLG than due to regular inelastic behavior. Thus, the results suggest that the SLG undergoes a gradual phase transition to a stiffer phase, although other properties of this phase remain unclear. It can also be noted that this phase transition is postulated to start occurring under shock compression of SLG to stresses above 5 GPa, which is also the threshold stress for the onset of the failure-wave phenomenon. It is, therefore, possible that the two phenomena are interrelated. The experimental results from this study are further used to construct a constitutive model to capture the unloading behavior of SLG.},

Using innovative X-ray measurements capturing the three-dimensional spatial volumetric strain fields, we demonstrate that rubbers and indeed many common engineering polymers undergo significant local volume changes. But remarkably, the overall specimen volume remains constant regardless of the imposed loading. This strange behavior which also leads to apparent negative local bulk moduli is due to the presence of a mobile phase within these materials. Combining X-ray tomographic observations with high-speed radiography to track the motion of the mobile phase, we have revised classical thermodynamic frameworks of rubber elasticity. The work opens broad avenues to understand not only the mechanical behavior of rubbers but a large class of widely used engineering polymers.},

	abstract = {We propose a computational framework, Hetero-EUCLID, for segmentation and parameter identification to characterize the full hyperelastic behavior of all constituents of a heterogeneous material. In this work, we leverage the Bayesian-EUCLID (Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery) framework to efficiently solve the heterogenized formulation through parsimonious model selection using sparsity-promoting priors and Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling. We utilize experimentally observable 3D surface displacement and boundary-averaged force data generated from Finite Element simulations of non-equi-biaxial tension tests on heterogeneous specimens. The framework broadly consists of two steps -- residual force-based segmentation, and constitutive parameter identification. We validate and demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to segment the domain, and characterize the constituent materials on various types of thin square heterogeneous domains. We validate of the framework's ability to segment and characterize materials with various levels of displacement noises and non-native mesh discretizations, i.e, using different meshes for the forward FE simulations and the inverse EUCLID problem. This demonstrates Hetero-EUCLID framework's applicability in Digital Image/Volume Correlation-based experimental scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed framework performs successful segmentation and material characterizations based on data from a single experiment, thereby making it viable for rapid, interpretable model discovery in domains such as aerospace and defense composites and for characterization of selective tissue stiffening in medical conditions such as fibroatheroma, atherosclerosis, or cancer.},
